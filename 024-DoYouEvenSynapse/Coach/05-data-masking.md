[< Previous Challenge](./04-incrementals.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./06-new-data.md)

## Notes and Guidance
- First names and last names are the main focus for the masks here
- Granular control of masking is the second key concept
- The masking solution should be explained and shown to the coach
