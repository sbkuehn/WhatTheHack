## Notes and Guidance
- Make sure that you have joined the Teams group for this track. The first person/coach on your team at your table should create a new channel in this Team with your team name.
- Install the recommended toolset:
    - Web browser to interact with Azure Portal and web-based data tools
    - [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
- Make sure your team creates the Teams channel for their team
- PowerBI Desktop is to be installed on their desktops
- Access to a web browser should be allowed as well
- Run the lab notebook ([Lab Data Prep.ipynb](Resources/Lab%20Data%20Prep.ipynb)) on a Synapse Spark Cluster. Coach will need to replace the path in the variable in the first code cell of the notebook to make the output data ("\dailyReports\", "\initialData\") available
- The lab notebook will split the data from OpenPowerlifting.org into an initial dataset and daily incremental datasets. This will be important in Challenge 4
