# Challenge 7: Leverage Machine Learning

[< Previous Challenge](./06-new-data.md) - **[Home](README.md)**

## Notes and Guidance
- Students will need to use a [Synapse Park Pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-studio) to complete this challenge
- [Apache Spark Pool Configurations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-pool-configurations)
- [Spark Pool Package Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-azure-portal-add-libraries)
- Use ML algorithms to Cluster lifters raw performance and see if there are more appropriate weight classes
