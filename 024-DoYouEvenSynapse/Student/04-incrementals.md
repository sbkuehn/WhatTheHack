# Challenge 4: Incremental Loads

[< Previous Challenge](./03-visualization.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./05-data-masking.md)

## Introduction
Making gains, get that data updated!

## Description
Additional results have been recorded. Your teamâ€™s task is to create a process to capture these new results and incorporate them into the reporting repository 

For simplification, it can be assumed that all new data is simply new event results (i.e., INSERTs).  No modification or deletion of past data is to be supported.

## Success Criteria
- Explained to your coach how you will incorporate the new data into your repository
- Demonstrated how the new data has been incorporated
- Shown updates to the visualizations as a result of the new data
- Created the ability to immediately send an alert (via the reporting tool or another notification mechanism) for any new personal records (PRs).
