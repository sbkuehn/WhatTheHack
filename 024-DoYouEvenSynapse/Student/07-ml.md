# Challenge 7: Leverage Machine Learning

[< Previous Challenge](./06-new-data.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction
The machines are learning!

## Description
CPF is considering re-defining their weight classes for their athletes. They have tasked your team to use machine learning algorithms to group (i.e. cluster) lifters raw performance and see if there are more appropriate weight classes. 


## Success Criteria
- Described the technologies and solutions used to achieve the above
- Provided an example visualization from your environment of the above
- Made a recommendation on whether there should be new weight classes 

## Learning Resources
- [Machine Learning app with Apache Spark MLlib and Azure Synapse Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-machine-learning-mllib-notebook)
