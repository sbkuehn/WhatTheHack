## Notes & Guidance

**IMPORTANT:** Check with your stakeholders that you are able to use your current Tenant/Subscription to run this Hack.  

Links to install the tooling for this hack:

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-5.6.0)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

If attendees will be using a shared Azure subscription, you should be aware of the following:

- Quotas are set per region.  If you increase the quota in a single region, you need to ensure that all students deploy to the same region.  Or else, they will bump up against the quota limits in the region they deploy to.
- If there is no access to an administrator who can request quota increases, have the students deploy to different regions to stay within the quota limit of each region.  

**NOTE:** Remember to point students to learning resources
