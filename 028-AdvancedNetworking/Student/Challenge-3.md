## Description

With the virtual network design in place, Contoso is now ready to deploy their applications. The applications are business critical, downtime can have a significant impact on business. Contoso's architecture should incorporate best practices and deploy a highly available architecture. The application also sees varying traffic patterns throughout the year. It is important to cater to the peak traffic patterns, however, Contosoâ€™s goal is also to reduce cost wherever possible.

<br />

For this challenge:

1. You need to ensure the web application servers scale to the incoming traffic.

2. Web servers should be protected from underlying network or hardware failures.

3. Cost is a concern for the customer. Resources should not be deployed when there isn't enough traffic.

<br />

## Success Criteria

- Application should be successfully accessible by external clients.

- Your solution has redundancy built in for resiliency.

- Your web servers and application gateway are able to scale to changing traffic.
