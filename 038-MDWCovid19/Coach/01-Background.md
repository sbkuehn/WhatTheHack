# Challenge 1: Coach's Guide

[< Previous Challenge](./00-PreReqs.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-Provision.md)

Your role as a coach is to encourage your team to work together to solve the
challenges for themselves. You may provide critical assessment of their ideas
and suggest potential avenues of exploration when they get stuck; but you should
*not* provide solutions to the challenges. The outcome that customers value most
from WhatTheHack is the satisfaction of having solved the challenges for
themselves, and the in-depth learning that comes from that experience.

So what *is* expected of a coach?

- Facilitating intra- (and inter-) team work to solve the challenges. Lead
    team discussions, being sure to include all team members. Act as a “sounding
    board” for team brainstorming while helping the team focused on the
    challenges and their success criteria.

- Unblocking technical issues that are not directly related to the challenges
    (for example, command line syntax or network authentication issues).

- Explaining underlying concepts where necessary. Participants can often find
    the code they need in documentation or on sites like StackOverflow; but they
    may have difficulty understanding what it is that they’re actually doing.

- Managing team sentiment and morale – the challenges are designed to be, er,
    challenging; and as a result, some participants may experience frustration
    at times during the Hach. Coaches need to be sensitive to the mood of
    the team and help steer them towards a breakthrough by asking leading
    questions, proposing alternative avenues of exploration, or just suggesting
    a coffee break.

- Validating challenge solutions against the specified criteria, and approving
    team progress through the challenges; being sure to celebrate the team’s
    successes along the way!

## Preparing to Coach This What The Hack - Recommendations

### 1. Build Foundational Knowledge

Coaches for the this Hack should have    knowledge of fundamental ETL and data
warehousing concepts, and familiarity with tools commonly used to move and
process data.

- Start by reading the Microsoft white paper on Modern Data Warehousing at
<https://aka.ms/msftmdw>, and the architectural guidance at
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/architecture/modern-data-warehouse>.
- You will also find a great deal of overlap in the “Perform data engineering with Azure Databricks” learning path at <https://aka.ms/learnmdw>.

### 2. Complete the Hack yourself

Ideally, you should try to complete the challenges using only the instructions
that the  participants will have, but you can also use the notes in
the rest of this guide for more detailed information and context that may
help you coach your team during the Hack itself.

### 3. Prepare to support your team and guide them to answers

There is no set way to accomplish the scussess criteria as multiple tools could be used (i.e. Synapse, DF, Pure SQL, Data Bricks) and will depend on your teams expertise. 

The coaches guide in each section is to help you prevent your team from gotchas and not to provide answers.
