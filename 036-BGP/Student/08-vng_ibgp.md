# Challenge 8: iBGP Between VNG Instances

[< Previous Challenge](./07-default.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Description

As you saw in previous challenges, for active/active gateways both gateway instances will form an iBGP adjacency between each other. Configure Azure so that you break that adjacency, and describe what is happening and why.

## Success Criteria

- Participants can understand the importance of not breaking the connectivity between VNG gateways, and what scenarios could introduce that problem
