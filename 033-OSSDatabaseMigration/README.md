# What The Hack - Intro To OSS DB Migration to Azure OSS DB
## Introduction
This intro level hackathon will help you get hands-on experience migrating databases from on-premises PostgreSQL and MySQL to Azure DB for PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Learning Objectives
In this hack you will solve a common challenge for companies migrating to the cloud: migrating open source databases to Azure. The application using the database is a sample e-commerce application written in Java (https://github.com/pzinsta/pizzeria). It will be configured to use both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

The participants will learn how to:

1. Perform a pre-migration assessment of the databases looking at size, database engine type, database version, etc.
1. Use offline tools to copy the databases to Azure OSS databases
1. Use the Azure Database Migration Service to perform an online migration
1. Do cutover and validation to ensure the application is working properly with the new configuration
1. Use a private endpoint for Azure OSS databases instead of a public IP address for the database
1. Configure a read replica for the Azure OSS databases

## Challenges
- Challenge 0: **[Pre-requisites - Setup Environment and Prerequisites!](Student/00-prereqs.md)**
   - Prepare your environment to run the sample application
- Challenge 1: **[Assessment (features differences and compatibility)](Student/01-assessment.md)**
   - Assess the application's PostgreSQL/MySQL databases
- Challenge 2: **[Size analysis](Student/02-size-analysis.md)**
   - Determine the CPU/memory configuration and database file size and map to an equivalent size in Azure
- Challenge 3: **[Offline migration](Student/03-offline-migration.md)**
   - Dump the "on-prem" databases, create databases for Azure DB for PostgreSQL/MySQL and restore them
- Challenge 4: **[Offline Cutover and Validation](Student/04-offline-cutover-validation.md)**
   - Reconfigure the application to use the appropriate connection string and validate that the application is working
- Challenge 5: **[Online Migration](Student/05-online-migration.md)**
   - Create new databases in Azure DB for PostgreSQL/MySQL and use the Azure Database Migration Service to replicate the data from the on-prem databases
- Challenge 6: **[Online Cutover and Validation](Student/06-online-cutover-validation.md)**
   - Reconfigure the application to use the appropriate connection string for Azure DB for PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Challenge 7: **[Private Endpoints](Student/07-private-endpoint.md)**
   - Reconfigure the application to use configure Azure DB for PostgreSQL/MySQL with a private endpoint so it can be used with a private IP address
- Challenge 8: **[Replication](Student/08-replication.md)**
   - Add an additional replica to the Azure DB for PostgreSQL/MySQL


## Prerequisites

   - If you don't have one, [Sign Up for Azure HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional)
