# Challenge 5: Process Steaming Data

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)


## Notes & Guidance
  - When creating the Stream Analytics job, be sure "Stream Analytics job" is being used and NOT "Stream Analytics cluster" or "Azure Stream Analytics on IoT Edge". Those services are related to what we're doing in this challenge but will not fit the requirements.
  
  - While businesses often have real-time or streaming analytics needs it's also important to have a holistic data estate strategy so outputting the aggregated stream data (in addition to the raw data streams, pre-aggregation) to the data lake will help in the long term enterprise data strategy.
