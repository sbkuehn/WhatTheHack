# Challenge 4: Time Series Analysis

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)


## Success Criteria

Verify challengers have performed the following:

- Created Azure Time Series Insight instance
- Define asset hierarchy
- Connect to Azure IoT instance created in earlier challenge to TSI instance
- Create visualization using incoming data metrics
- Create dashboard to display multiple charts

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

It would also make sense to discuss how they can integrate existing application with TSI dashboards [Integrating TSI with C# application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Time-Series-Insights). Also, discuss how they can use REST API to fetch the data from TSI instance [REST API for TSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/time-series-insights/)
