# Coach's Guide: Challenge 4 - Connect to FHIR Server and read FHIR data through a JavaScript app

[< Previous Challenge](./Solution03.md) - **[Home](./readme.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Solution05.md)

## Notes & Guidance

In this challenge, you will deploy a **[FHIR sample JavaScript app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/tutorial-web-app-write-web-app)** to connect and read FHIR patient data.  You will configure **[public client application registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-public-azure-ad-client-app)** to allow JavaScript app to access FHIR Server.

**[Public Client Application registrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-public-azure-ad-client-app)** are Azure AD representations of apps that can authenticate and authorize for API permissions on behalf of a user. Public clients are mobile and SPA JavaScript apps that can't be trusted to hold an application secret, so you don't need to add one.  For a SPA, you can enable implicit flow for app user sign-in with ID tokens and/or call a protected web API with Access tokens.

**You will deploy a FHIR sample JavaScript app in Azure to read patient data from the FHIR service.**
- **[Create a new Azure Web App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/tutorial-web-app-write-web-app#create-web-application)** in Azure Portal to host the FHIR sample JavaScript app.
- Check in secondary Azure AD tenant (can be primary tenant if you already have directory admin privilege) that a **[Resource Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-resource-azure-ad-client-app)** has been registered for the FHIR Server resource.

    **Note:** 
    - If you are using the Azure API for FHIR, a Resource Application is automatically created when you deploy the service in same AAD tenant as your application.
    - In the FHIR Server Sample environment deployment, a Resource Application is automatically created for the FHIR Server resource.

- **[Register a public client application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/tutorial-web-app-public-app-reg)** in secondary Azure AD tenant (can be primary tenant if you already have directory admin privilege) to allow the deployed Web App to authenticate and authorize for FHIR Server API access.
  - Go to Azure AD and switch to your secondary Azure AD tenant (can be primary tenant if you already have directory admin privilege)
  - Click `App Registration` and add a new Public client/native (mobile & desktop) registration or open existing one if already exist (from FHIR Server Samples deployment).
    - Capture `client ID` and `tenant ID` from `Overview` blade for use in later step.
  - Connect with web app
    - Select `Authentication` blade, click `Add a new platform` and select `Web`
      - Add `https://[WEB-APP-NAME].azurewebsites.net` to `redirect URI` list.
      - Select `Access tokens` and `ID tokens` check boxes and click `Configure`.
  - Add `API Permissions`
    - Select `API permissions` blade and click `Add a new permission`
    - Select `APIs my organization uses`, search for `Azure Healthcare APIs` and select it.
    - Select `user_impersonation` and click `add permissions`.
- Update the sample JavaScript app to connect and read FHIR patient data from your FHIR Serer.
  - Start with the sample code from the **[FHIR patient JavaScript app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/tutorial-web-app-write-web-app)** site or **[index.html](../Student/Resources/JavaScript-Sample/index.html)** file in the Student Resources folder. 
  - Open App Service resource for sample web app in Azure Portal.
    - Select App Service Editor and select `index.html` file to open it in the editor.
    - Paste the sample code into the editor to replace the content.
    - Initialize **[MSAL ((Mirosoft Authentication Library) provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/providers/msal)** configuration object for your FHIR environment:
        - `clientId` - Update with your client application ID of public client app registered earlier
        - `authority` - Update with Authority from your FHIR Server (under Authentication)
        - `FHIRendpoint` - Update the FHIRendpoint to have your FHIR service name
        - `Scopes` - Update with Audience from your FHIR Server (under Authentication)
      
      **Note:** App Services Editor automatically saves changes.
- Test sample JavaScript app
  - Browse to App Service website URL in a new In-private / InCognito window
  - Sign in with your secondary tenant (can be primary tenant if you already have directory admin privilege) used in deploying FHIR Server Samples reference architecture
  - You should see a list of patients that were loaded into FHIR Server.
