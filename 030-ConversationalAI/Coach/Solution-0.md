# Challenge 0: Setting up Bot Composer

**[Home](./Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Solution-1.md)

## Notes & Guidance
- It will take some time to install all of the resources, get them started on installing the Bot Composer and then double check their understanding of the challenge.
- The Desktop app is relatively easier to install, but does take room on your desktop so it's a trade off
- Make sure they have the latest Bot Framework emulator, earlier versions will cause issues down the road
- If you are getting any odd issues like the Language Generation not loading correctly, have the participant uninstall and reinstall bot composer.
- If there are issues with starting the bot double check the firewall permissions.
