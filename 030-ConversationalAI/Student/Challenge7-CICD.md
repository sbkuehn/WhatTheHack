# Challenge 7: Implement DevOps best practices into your Bot 
[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge6-ACS.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** 
## Introduction
We've now finished deploying our Bot into Azure. In order to make it a enterprise level repeatable solution, the team needs to automate a CI/CD pipeline
	
## Description

1. Export our Bot to a Run Time

2. Make sure exported run time is linked to you GitHub/DevOps repo

3. Set up Continuous Integration pipeline in your GitHub/DevOps project to automatically build the Web App 

4. Set up a Continuous Deployment (CD) to deploy the project. Make sure the BOT API, QnA Knowledge Base, and LUIS are considered in the CD. 


## Success Criteria
* The Bot local Run Time is created
* Have completed CI and CD pipelines 
* What a sample result looks like:
