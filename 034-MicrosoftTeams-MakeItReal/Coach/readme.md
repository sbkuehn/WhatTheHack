# What The Hack - Microsoft Teams: Make It Real
## Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Microsoft Teams: Make It Real What The Hack. Here you will find links to guidance for coaches for each of the challenges, notes about setting up the hack, and sample Powershell scripts that will help you get setup more quickly.

Also remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge as well as demo recommendations. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.

There is also a [sample email invite](./Resources/SampleInvite.oft) you can customize to market this event with your customers.
