# Challenge 3: Citizen Services

[< Previous Challenge](./02-firstresponders.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Pre-requisites
For this challenge, you must have at least setup Microsoft Teams in accordace with the goals in Challenge 1. 

## Description
Contoso would also like to use Office 365 services to improve the way they interact with the public during an emergency. There is very little of this direct engagement today as Contoso mainly relies on the media or other third parties. They would like your team to explore the “art-of-the-possible” in providing solutions to these scenarios: 

Contoso has learned from past experiences, that during an emergency they often get offers from the public to volunteer for services that would indeed offer value to supplement their staff. In the past, those offers have arrived through various methods such as phone calls and emails to specific Contoso employees. Ideally, there would be a standardized way to gather information about the volunteer. This information should then be reviewed (and verified) by a Contoso staff member. Lastly, the information on approved volunteers should be easily accessible to the emergency response team. 

Another citizen facing service for emergencies is enabling the public to request status information for individuals that are missing. Ideally, there would be a process for citizens to provide details of the person missing such as name, gender, address, age, etc. This information is then available to the response team. In a perfect world, there would be a report of some kind that breaks down this data by gender and/or city where the team can easily interact with the data.  


## Success Criteria

1. A volunteer can provide information about themselves which is routed to a Contoso staff member for verification. 
1. A collection of verified volunteers is available to the response team. 
1. A citizen can provide the details of a missing person to the response team.
1. The response team can see the missing person data.
