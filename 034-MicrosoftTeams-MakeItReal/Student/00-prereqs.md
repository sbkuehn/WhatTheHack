## Introduction

This challenge details the requirements for your M365 tenant in preparation for taking on the challenges in the hack. If your coach is providing a tenant, confirm that this work has been done for you.  

## Description

- If you don't have a Microsoft 365 tenant and your coach is not providing one, [Sign Up for Office 365 E5 HERE](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=US)
- If you are not using a tenant that a coach is providing, you will need admin level access to Azure AD and policies to do some of the advanced challenges. The ability to create a new team in Microsoft Teams is the minimum.
- If you received your own trial tenant, you will also need to add trial subscriptions/licenses for Microsoft Teams Domestic Calling plans. This can be done from the admin center. This [Setting Up Calling Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-calling-plans) guide details how to get the licenses and assign phone numbers to the user accounts you will be using for the demo.
- You will need the [Power BI Desktop Client](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- Make sure Microsoft Office is installed on your machine and that you can sign into Office using a user credential from your tenant.
- Sign into the [OneDrive client](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-onedrive-work-or-school-b30da4eb-ddd2-44b6-943b-e6fbfc6b8dde) on your machine using a user credential from your tenant.
- Having access to a mobile device that can use the Office 365 apps to sign into your tenant is desired but not a requirement.
