# Challenge 2: Supporting First Responders

[< Previous Challenge](./01-collaboration.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./03-citizenservices.md)

## Pre-requisites
For this challenge, you must have at least setup Microsoft Teams in accordace with the goals in Challenge 1. Your tenant must have phone conferencing configured for Microsoft Teams meetings. Your group will also need access to a mobile device that you can sign into with your tenant's user credentials. For the Advanced Challenges, you must have admin level rights in the tenant configure Azure AD and corresponding policies.

## Description
During Contosoâ€™s review, many of the complaints were from users who were first responders to the site of an emergency. These users are highly mobile and are often in areas where services may be interrupted or unavailable. It is especially important for first responders to be able to communicate back with the main offices on mobile devices. They need to be able to take standard procedures and documentation related to the emergency into the field where there may be little to no network connectivity. Nightly, there is a standing call for each first responding team (which is usually comprised of 50 to 200 people per team). Keep in mind that this meeting is critical, and the team might not be able to count on any infrastructure services other then a phone in the hotel where they are staying. 

Often, these first responders gather key photos from the scene that are used to make strategy decisions by the larger response team. There is no consistent way this gets done today, and Contoso needs a way to standardize how this information is gathered and routed. Images captured by field personnel could be related to infrastructure concerns, like structural problems to buildings, roads, or bridges. Other examples could be requests for additional support or equipment such as more people, fire support, additional lighting equipment, etc. Ideally, a first responder could capture a picture and provide details of their request.  Then, either the Logistics or Engineering Team for that emergency should be notified of the request based on the type of information. 


## Success Criteria

1. Demonstrate that a user can access the emergency information from a mobile device.
1. Demonstrate that a user can take a set of documents from the emergency documentation offline on a device. 
1. Demonstrate the ability to schedule and host a meeting where a user could dial in through telephony without the Microsoft Teams client. 
1. Demonstrate how your team suggests standardizing the photo gathering business process of first responders. Based on the photo and information gathered, either the Logistics or Engineering team should be notified of the request. 

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!*

1. If the mobile device is not managed by the organization, the user is prompted for the multi-factor authentication.
